## 🗂️ Project Structure

This Android project follows standard Android architecture patterns:

- **`/app/src/main/java/com/gworks/dartscape/`** - Main application source code
  - **`data/`** - Game data models and player information
  - **`database/`** - SQLite database management and player statistics
  - **`fragments/`** - UI fragments for different screens and game modes
  - **`logic/`** - Core game logic and scoring algorithms
  - **`main/`** - Main activity and application initialization
  - **`ui/`** - Custom UI components and views
  - **`util/`** - Utility classes for sounds, themes, and helper functions

### How It Works

**For Players:**

- Select game mode and configure settings (`HomeFragment.java`)
- Add players, teams, or bots (`PlayersFragment.java`)
- Play games with real-time scoring (`GameFragment.java`)
- View detailed statistics and history (`StatsFragment.java`)

**For Developers:**

- Game logic is centralized in `GameLogic.java` with data models in `/data/`
- UI components are modular fragments managed by `FragManager.java`
- Database operations handled by `PlayerDatabase.java` for statistics persistence
- Custom themes and sounds managed through utility classes

**Architecture Benefits:**

- Clean separation between game logic, UI, and data layers
- Modular fragment system allows easy addition of new game modes
- Centralized data management ensures consistency across all features
- Professional code structure suitable for team development and maintenance
